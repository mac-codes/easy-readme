  ## Description
  Welcome to my easy README.md generator. this program will generate a README file through the command line. I used fs and inquirer to write and execute the file. We were asked to include a table of contents, and section to contact us if the user has any questions, the title of the project, credits that include my name and a way to choose the licsense the user is using to write the program. I really enjoyed the backend side of coding! its fun.
